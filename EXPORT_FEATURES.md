   - Test Print - verify layout in print preview

2. **Responsiveness**:
   - Test on mobile (< 768px)
   - Test on tablet (768-1024px)
   - Test on desktop (> 1024px)
   - Verify all layouts work correctly

3. **Animations**:
   - Verify smooth entrance effects
   - Enable reduced-motion in browser settings
   - Verify animations are disabled but functionality works

4. **Themes**:
   - Test all features in light mode
   - Switch to dark mode
   - Verify colors, contrasts, and readability

5. **Error Handling**:
